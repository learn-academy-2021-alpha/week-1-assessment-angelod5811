# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: a function takes in an argument that will execute a command

  Researched answer: Functions are reusable pieces of code that only execute when "called" and always return an output
Functions can have information passed into the scope of the function through an "argument"
Functions are designed to be used many times in a program and should be as generic as possible while still being descriptive as to their purpose



2. What is the difference between .map() and .filter()?

  Your answer: .map() returns an array of the same length and .filter() returns subset of array its on and makes a deceision to returne a certain value in an array

  Researched answer: Map takes all objects in a list and allows you to apply a function to it whereas Filter takes all objects in a list and runs that through a function to create a new list with all objects that return True in that function.



3. What is the difference between console.log() and return?

  Your answer: console.log() is how to communicate with the terminal and using code to return a value so you can see it in the console log

  Researched answer:The main purpose of the return value, is to use the function return value like you would have use a variable value. the console. log(); is a function (you can see the brackets) that will write the argument value on the console



4. In regards to functions, what is an argument?

  Your answer: An argument in a function is going to tell the function how to execute the rest of the code following in order. An argument could be a for loop for example.

  Researched answer:Pieces of outside information that is used when a function runs are called arguments to that function. We put the arguments inside the parentheses of the function.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: pair programming is 1 computer, 2 keyboards, 2 people, 2 screens. There is a driver and there is a navigator. The driver is responsible for writing and typing the code and the navigator is suppposed to check any mistakes made and keep the driver from making errors.

  Researched answer:Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.



6. What is iteration?

  Your answer: iteration is repeating a command until a condition is met, arrays for example.

  Researched answer:An explanation of iteration, as used in algorithms and programming. Transcript. Algorithms consist of steps that are carried out (performed) one after another. Sometimes an algorithm needs to repeat certain steps until told to stop or until a particular condition has been met.



7. What are advantages and disadvantages for using terminal commands to interact with your computer?

  Your answer: The advantages are that you're able to see if your code can fully run and is complete. disadvantages would be you could get really lost inside your computer if you don't know what you're doing.

  Researched answer: The Terminal provides an efficient interface to access the true power of a computer better than any graphical interface. disadvantages would be that, you can't easily take it around with you, unless you have some way of connecting to your host computer where ever you go.



8. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: What I found helpful in the class was the ability to pop back out of breakout rooms and ask the instructor questions about what we are currently working on.
